test-id	new-node	page1	page2	goal	notes
test1	nn14	dh1	dh2	0	kingdom/partial ancestor match not sufficient to overcome family conflict
test2	nn1	dh1	dh2	dh1	child match overcomes family conflict in the absence of major ancestry conflict (i.e., kindom conflict involving animalia)
test3	nn2	dh1	dh2	dh1	partial child match decisive in the absence of other info
test4	nn3	dh1	dh2	dh1	partial ancestry match decisive in the absence of other info
test5	nn14	dh13	dh2	dh13	family conflict resolved by ancestry of other node in page from curated hierarchy
test6	nn14	dh14	dh2	0	family conflict not resolved by ancestry of other node in page from non-curated hierarchy
test7	nn4	dh1	dh2	0	kingdom match not sufficient to overcome authority conflict
test8	nn4	dh2	dh3	dh3	synonym with authority match decisive in the absence of major conflicts
test9	nn4	dh2	dh4	dh4	synonym with authority match decisive, authority string match does not have to be perfect
test10	nn4	dh2	dh5	dh5	synonym with authority match decisive, authority string match does not have to be perfect
test11	nn4	dh2	dh6	dh6	synonym with authority match decisive, authority string match does not have to be perfect
test12	nn4	dh2	dh7	dh7	other node from curated hierarchy synonym match decisive
test13	nn4	dh2	dh8	0	other node from non-curated hierarchy synonym match not sufficient
test14	nn5	dh2	dh3	0	authority match cannot overcome kingdom mismatch involving animalia; kingdom match not sufficient to overcome authority mismatch
test15	nn6	dh9	dh10	0	not enough info to distinguish between homonyms
test16	nn7	dh9	dh10	dh10	authority match sufficient to distinguish between homonyms
test17	nn8	dh9	dh10	dh10	abbreviated authority match sufficient to distinguish between homonyms
test18	nn9	dh9	dh10	dh9	kingdom sufficient to distinguish between homonyms because one is animalia, the other is not
test19	nn10	dh9	dh10	0	partial ancestor match, but much of ancestry conflicts, most significantly: family conflict
test20	nn11	dh9	dh10	0	partial ancestor match, but most of ancestry conflicts
test21	nn12	dh9	dh10	dh10	significant ancestor conflict, but families match
test22	nn13	dh9	dh10	0	if families conflict, a kingdom match is not sufficient
test23	nn10	dh9	dh11	dh11	family conflict is neutralized by family match with other node from curated hierarchy, other ancestry conflicts are not significant
test24	nn10	dh9	dh12	0	family match with other node from non-curated hierarchy cannot neutralize dynamic hierarchy family conflict
test25	nn15	dh15	dh16	dh15	class/phylum does not constitute a significant rank conflict, any rank conflict involving genus would be significant
test26	nn16	dh15	dh16	0	never match anything with rank genus to anything that's not rank genus (need to think some more about subgenus situation)
test27	nn17	dh15	dh16	dh17	author information sufficient to match
test28	nn18	d17	d18	d18	partial ancestor match in the absence of conflict; kingdom mismatch is just a non-significant rank conflict
test29	nn19	d17	d18	0	family conflict overrules partical ancestor match
test30	nn20	d17	d18	d18	authority match overcomes family conflict
